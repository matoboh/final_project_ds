# Introduction

The exploration of space has always symbolized a major achievement for humanity, arousing our curiosity and inspiring entire generations to explore the immensity of the unknown. Space launches mark crucial milestones in our quest to understand the universe, constantly pushing the boundaries of science and technology.

This project undertakes an in-depth analysis of space launch data, with the aim of revealing several parameters such as:

- How many launches were occurred in each year?

- What was the first artificial satellite launched into the space?

- Which space agency launched the first space station, and when did it occur? 

- How many launches were conducted by United States(US) and Russia?

- Which countries or space agencies have been the most active in terms of space launches?

Letâ€™s dig deeper and answer these pressing questions!
Our project studies around 5726 space launch reviews with characteristics such as tag, JD, mission, agency etc. This is our final project for the Introduction to Data Science course (Fall 2023) which will give you an overview of our analysis.

# Necessary Libraries 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

```
# Dataset

```{r}
#read data through its link:
launches <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-15/launches.csv")
```
## Rating classification
Launches are normally classified in categories as found on this [website](https://aerospace.csis.org/data/space-environment-total-launches-by-country/). To create a more rich dataset we added the field rating_category determined as:

```{r}
print(launches)
```
Notice: We have got through this data, 5726 rows and 11 columns.


## Exploration of the structure of dataset

```{r}
str(launches)
```


We need to use head() or tail() because it can be helpful to ensure that the data is loaded correctly and to understand the variable names and values before proceeding with further analysis or visualization.

```{r}
head(launches)
```
## Inspect the column names for "Launches":
```{r}
colnames(launches)
```

       "JD": In the context of space launches, "JD" typically stands for "Julian Date." The Julian Date is a continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period,         which began on January 1, 4713 BCE.
       
       Regarding "Variant" in space launches, it generally refers to different versions or configurations of a particular launch vehicle or spacecraft.
       
       In more general terms, "tag" could refer to a label or identifier associated with a particular aspect of a space mission.
       


## Look at the data frame in Launches

```{r}
view(launches)
```

## Cleaning data
### Checking for missing values

By checking for missing values, you can make informed decisions about how to handle them and ensure the reliability of your analysis.

```{r}
summarize_missing <- launches %>% 
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.)))
print(summarize_missing)

```
Notice: We have 13 missing values in launch_date
                4981 missing values in variant column
                21 missing values in mission and
                2444 missing values in agency column.
                


### Impute missing values based on data type
We are going to clean some datasets to fix missing values
```{r}
launches_imputed <- launches %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~if_else(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .)),
         across(where(is.character), ~if_else(is.na(.), "Unknown", .)))
```


### Find missing values
```{r}
missing_values_imputed <- launches_imputed %>%
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.)))
print(missing_values_imputed)
```

### Dislay Missing values
```{r}
launches_no_missing <- launches_imputed %>%
  drop_na()
```

We need to write this code to provide clarity in the code about what the subsequent output represents.

```{r}
print(launches_no_missing)
```
### Check the no missing values for launches

```{r}
view(launches_no_missing)
```


# Data Exploration

Before, conducting any detailed analysis of our dataset, we looked at a quick summary of the dataset about Launches.

```{r}
summary(launches)
```
## Univariate Exploration
To gain deeper insights into the distribution of our space launch data, we conducted straightforward uni variate visualizations focused on specific parameters. Prior to delving into multivariate analyses to address our research questions, it is imperative to validate the robustness of our dataset and its fidelity as an accurate reflection of real-world space launch activities.

### Count number of launches
The following visualization illustrates the distribution of our dataset with respect to the count of launches. To enhance our comprehension and visualization of the data, we organized the graph according to the number of launches in specific categories. It is evident that a significant portion of the launches falls within the 12%-15% range. Considering that Real Simple states the average alcohol content of wine is typically between 11%-13%, the prevalence of launches in our dataset aligns well with real-world trends. This reinforces our confidence in the accuracy and representatives of the data.


## Multivariate Exploration
Having gained a comprehensive insight into our space launch dataset and confirming its fidelity as a true reflection of real-world scenarios, we are now poised to undertake a more intricate analysis by incorporating multiple variables.


### Count number of polls per launch date?


```{r}
launches%>%
  filter(month(launch_date)== 4)%>%
  nrow()
```
A launch date had 504 polls.


### Use mutate to create "Thor Burner 2" 
```{r}
 launches <- launches %>%
  mutate(contains_thor_burner_2 = str_detect(type, "Thor Burner 2"))

```

### Filter rows wherebcondition is true

```{r}
thor_burner_2_launches <- launches %>%
  filter(contains_thor_burner_2)
```


### Print the result
```{r}
print(thor_burner_2_launches)
```


## Summary statistics


```{r}
summary(launches[c("tag", "launch_year")])
```
Notice: we can see through this table that there was the first launch into space in 1957.

### What was the first artificial satellite launched into the space?

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the earth's first artificial satellite, Sputnik I. The successful launch came as a shock to experts and citizens in the United States, who had hoped that the United States would accomplish this scientific advancement first.The Sputnik launch marked the start of the space age and the US-USSR space race, and led to the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
